 So we are barely tokenized. This is our D app. And so we are a website to facilitate the moment of renewable energy resources through blockchain. We implement security through ZK Snacks, which are zero knowledge proofs. We implement free to be trading and smart grid integration. So we are solving these challenges and there's our headlion highlights. So let's get started with the application. So as you can see in the interface, it doesn't let us buy energy or sell energy until we connect with our wallet. So we can collect to the wallet. So actually it is connected to Metamask. So if you are a new user, it will ask for your permissions. So let's buy energy. So let's see if we have any funds remaining in our wallet. So our initial account balance is 44.5 and we have 5 weeks. Let's say we buy one and deposit 10. Let's place the bit. So as you can see it asks for our permissions. You place the bit. It also shows in the trading history. Then we deposit funds. As you can see the amount is 10. And the transaction is confirmed. So if we go to our wallet, which you can see 34.8 is the remaining balance and 15.8 is the contract funds. So now if someone wants to sell energy, so we can refresh the page. So it disconnects. And in the Metamask, we can select our dummy accounts to show the purpose of selling. Let's say we select a count six and we connect with the account. Connect wallet. You can see it has 99.85 each balance. And in the cell energy, we can sell one clover to our net. So this process will go throughout the day. And at the end of the day or the start of the day, in the server will have a execute energy function, which will be called automatically. Since it will be called only month. We have provided a button in the front end to for the demo purposes. Let's see what happens. You can see the seller has gained one eith from the transaction. And if we can also withdraw this. And let's wait some time to update the balance. So the balance is also up to 200 and 0.8. So we can also view the other account. You can see it has 14 eiths. Earlier it has 15 eith. We can also do withdraw funds in this. So you can see also 1002 kilowatt-r is the energy. Initially it was 101. So this data will be passed through IoT and will be updated when the execute energy is called on the server, which will be run by a Python script one third day or once a week, whatever the frequency of the server is set. And you can also see the transactions. These are the earlier transactions we have did and this was the latest. This is the latest. So, one eiths and you can also see the rate and time. So in the future aspects of the app, we also have carbon credits, which will be used to do the energy purchases and we also have a DSO. So if the all the energy exchange have happened and you still want some more energy, you can buy from DSO. So you can see the DSO rate is 8 eith to do it. These are dynamically changed by the server. So we have 14 eith in our account. Let's say we want to buy 1 kilowatt-r up energy. Its cost is 8 eith. We do buy from DSO. And as you can see the 6 eiths is remaining. We can also sell to DSO. So now 8 eith is there. So yeah, that's all from us.
